Diabetes Prediction Model

Created a prediction model on PIMA INDIAN Diabetes data with a respectable 78.35% accuracy.

The accuracy was based upon test data which was not used in model creation.

The csv files used are in csv folder and the R code are included in the script folder. The folder GUI consists server/ui r script.
All of the function might not run in standard R packages and additional packages should be installed accordingly. For the server to run
it is vital to load the same environment in Rstudio that was created while running the scripts. The working directory should be set to csv folder.
It is recommended to run the code line wise.

The detailed documentation of the project is included as 'documentation' in Word file. It contains detailed processes, decisions, choices, results, comparision, plots, acuuracy and all the things necessary for explanation, understanding and reasoning of processes.
